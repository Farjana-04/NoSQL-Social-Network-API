# NoSQL-Sociel-Network-API

## Description:

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
This Challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. 
We’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, 
we may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of our choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
